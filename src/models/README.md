# Rental Price Prediction for structural data using MLPRegressor and XGBoost

This project aims to predict rental prices for properties using two different machine learning models: MLPRegressor (Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor) and XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting). The dataset used for training and testing the models is sourced from rental property listings and includes various features such as living space, location, and amenities.

## Overview

- **Problem**: Predict rental prices for properties based on their attributes.
- **Data**: The dataset consists of rental property listings with features such as living space, location, and amenities.
- **Models**:
  - **MLPRegressor**: A neural network-based regression model implemented using PyTorch.
  - **XGBoost**: An implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm optimized for parallel tree boosting.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is processed and prepared using the `RentalDataModule` class.
2. **Model Tuning**:
   - MLPRegressor: Train the MLPRegressor model using the `mlp_objective` function for hyperparameter tuning.
   - XGBoost: Train the XGBoost model using the `xgb_objective` function for hyperparameter tuning.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics such as R-squared (R2) score.
   - Compare the performance of MLPRegressor and XGBoost models.
4. **Visualization**:
   - Plot the actual rental prices against the predicted prices for visual analysis.
   - Compare the predictions of MLPRegressor and XGBoost models using scatter plots.
